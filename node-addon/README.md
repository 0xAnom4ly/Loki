# Node Addons
These are examples of node addons for execution. Test scripts are provided but must have their paths configured to work. You should be able to open any project in Visual Studio and just build normally.

## Requirements
* This uses Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 v143

## Other
* Does not bypass WDAC since the `.node` is unsigned
